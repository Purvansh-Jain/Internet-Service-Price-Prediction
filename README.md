## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of internet service plans using data from various Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Utilizing a Kaggle dataset, we performed comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and employed regression techniques including Linear Regression, SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forests, GBM, and XG-Boost.

## Key Findings
- Tree-based models, notably Random Forests and GBM, showcased superior accuracy in predicting internet service prices.
- Data visualization and EDA were crucial in understanding the impact of demographics and provider features on pricing.

## Data
The dataset encompasses diverse ISPs, merged and cleaned for analysis.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building and Evaluation

## Results
Our analysis offers insights that can assist consumers in making informed decisions regarding internet service plans. Tree-based models emerged as the most effective in predicting service prices accurately.

## Usage
This project is intended for educational purposes and to aid in the decision-making process for internet service consumers.
